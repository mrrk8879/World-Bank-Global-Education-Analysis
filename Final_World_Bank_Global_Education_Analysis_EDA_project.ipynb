To address different problem statements, a repetitive process involves extracting data for a specific indicator, cleaning the DataFrame by dropping columns with all NaN values, filling missing values using the linear interpolation method in both directions, and handling outliers using the IQR method. To streamline and enhance our workflow, we aim to develop functions that facilitate these tasks. These functions will provide a systematic approach to extract indicator-specific data, perform efficient data cleaning, and handle outliers consistently across multiple problem statements, contributing to a more organized and robust exploratory data analysis (EDA) process."

        "1. **Economic Dependency:**\n",
        "\n",
        "  The enrollment rates in tertiary education are intricately tied to the economic conditions of a country, the income levels of its citizens, and the efficacy of its education system.\n",
        "For countries lacking a robust education system, students often seek opportunities abroad for better education and future prospects.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Income-Enrollment Relationship:**\n",
        "\n",
        "  The graph highlights a direct correlation between enrollment rates and the income of households and in which gruop it falls.\n",
        "In the Low-Income group, enrollment rates are notably low, hovering around 3%, and show a modest increase to 5% (an 8% increase) by 2015. This underscores the need for focused governmental efforts to improve the education system and elevate the country's socioeconomic standing.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Incomplete Enrollment:**\n",
        "\n",
        "  Notably, enrollment ratios across all income groups did not reach 100%, indicating a significant number of students discontinuing their studies after completing secondary education.\n",

        "####**Explanation:**\n",
        "1. **Data Extraction:**\n",
        "\n",
        "  The code starts by extracting data related to government expenditure on education as a percentage of GDP (SE.XPD.TOTL.GD.ZS) using the data_extractor function.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Data Cleaning:**\n",
        "\n",
        "  The extracted data is then cleaned by removing duplicate rows and columns with a high percentage of missing values (20 is the threshold for dropping columns) using the data_cleaner function. The resulting DataFrame (df_gee) is a cleaned representation of government expenditure data.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Year Selection and Reshaping:**\n",
        "  The code then selects the years between 1995 and 2015 for more accurate analysis. Subsequently, it reshapes the DataFrame (df_gee) into a long format suitable for visualization using the melt function. The resulting DataFrame (df_gee_melt) has columns 'Country Name', 'Years', and 'Govt Expenditure'.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Data Preparation for Adult Literacy Rate:**\n",
        "  The code uses the existing DataFrame (df_alr) for adult literacy rate analysis. It transposes (T) the DataFrame to have 'Country Name' as columns, resets the index, and then cleans the data by removing duplicates and null values.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Reshaping Adult Literacy Rate Data:**\n",
        "  The adult literacy rate DataFrame (df_alr_9) is then reshaped into a long format suitable for visualization using the melt function. The resulting DataFrame (df_alr_melt_9) has columns 'Country Name', 'Years', and 'Adult Literacy Rate'.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Merging Datasets:**\n",
        "  The code merges the two reshaped DataFrames (df_gee_melt and df_alr_melt_9) on 'Country Name' and 'Years' using pd.merge() with an inner join. The resulting DataFrame (df9) now contains information about government expenditure on education and adult literacy rates for various countries over different years.\n",
        "\n",
        "The subsequent code filters the merged DataFrame (df9) for specific countries of interest and creates separate DataFrames for each country. These individual DataFrames can be analyzed further to investigate the relationship between government spending on education and adult literacy rates in these countries."

        "1. **Extract Data:**\n",
        "\n",
        "  Use the data_extractor function to obtain two dataframes: df_gpp_net for the Net Enrollment Ratio (NER) GPI and df_gpp_complete for the Primary Completion Rate GPI.\n",

        "  Clean the df_gpp_net dataframe using the data_cleaner function, specifying a threshold of 45 non-NaN values for data integrity. Reset the index for subsequent operations.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Filter Data (Net Enrollment Ratio GPI):**\n",
        "\n",
        "  Select data only for the specified countries (countries_10) in the df_gpp_net dataframe.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Melt Data (Net Enrollment Ratio GPI):**\n",
        "\n",
        "  Reshape the df_gpp_net dataframe using the melt function, transforming it into a format suitable for visualization.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Clean Data (Primary Completion Rate GPI):**\n",
        "\n",
        "  Clean the df_gpp_complete dataframe using the data_cleaner function, setting a threshold of 35 non-NaN values. Reset the index for further manipulations.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Filter Data (Primary Completion Rate GPI):**\n",
        "\n",
        "  Select data only for the specified countries (countries_10) in the df_gpp_complete dataframe.\n",
        "\n",

        "  Reshape the df_gpp_complete dataframe using the melt function, preparing it for visualization.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. **Merge Dataframes:**\n",
        "\n",
        "  Combine both melted dataframes (df_gpp_net_melt and df_gpp_melt_complete) based on common columns 'Country Name' and 'Years' using the pd.merge function.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. **Data Type Conversion:**\n",
        "\n",
        "  Change the datatype of the 'Years' column in the merged dataframe (df_gpp) to datetime for better analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. **Drop Null Values:**\n",
        "\n",
        "  Remove rows with null values in the merged dataframe (df_gpp).\n",
        "\n",
        "11. **Extract Specific Years:**\n",
        "\n",
        "  Retain only the years at 5-year intervals in the df_gpp dataframe.\n",
        "  \n",
        "12. **Display Top 5 Rows:**\n",
        "\n",

        "The term \"teacher-student ratio\" refers to the number of teachers divided by the number of students in a particular educational setting. It is a measure commonly used in education to assess the relationship between the number of teachers available and the number of students they are responsible for. The ratio is often expressed in the form of \"X:1,\" where X is the number of students for each teacher.\n",
        "\n",
        "A lower teacher-student ratio is generally considered beneficial because it suggests that each teacher has a smaller number of students to attend to, allowing for more personalized attention and potentially better educational outcomes. Conversely, a higher ratio may indicate larger class sizes and less individualized attention for students.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "The optimal range for teacher-student ratios can vary based on educational levels, teaching methodologies, and other factors. However, some general guidelines exist:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Lower Ratios for Early Education**: In early education settings (such as pre-primary and primary schools), lower ratios are often preferred. Smaller class sizes can be conducive to fostering a supportive learning environment, especially for young children who may need more individualized attention.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Varied Ratios for Secondary Education**: In secondary education, the optimal ratio may vary based on factors like subject complexity, teaching methodologies, and the age group of students. Smaller ratios are generally considered advantageous, but they may be less strictly adhered to than in primary education.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Higher Education**: In higher education (colleges and universities), the concept of teacher-student ratio may become less straightforward. Larger lecture-style classes are common, and the focus may shift more toward the quality of teaching and available resources rather than a specific numerical ratio.\n",
        "\n",
        "It's important to note that while teacher-student ratios provide insights, they are just one factor among many influencing the overall quality of education. Other factors, such as teacher qualifications, classroom resources, and curriculum design, also play crucial roles in determining educational outcomes."

However, during the data wrangling process, a significant number of indicators were excluded due to insufficient data availability, resulting in a considerable number of NaN values. This curation was essential to ensure the quality and reliability of the dataset for our correlation analysis. The rigorous filtering criteria aimed to retain indicators with sufficient data points, enabling a more meaningful and robust exploration of relationships between the selected variables. This strategic approach enhances the overall credibility and interpretability of our correlation analysis."

        "In today's scenario, education has become a means to generate income, with many individuals turning to platforms like YouTube to offer teaching services. However, the concern arises for economically disadvantaged students who lack access to smartphones. Amidst the lockdown, when the government instructed people to stay indoors, schools and colleges swiftly transitioned to online teaching without considering the plight of those who couldn't afford smartphones. This raises a critical issue as many families struggled to provide even basic necessities, let alone a device for their children's education. The government's lack of action in addressing this digital divide further exacerbates the challenges faced by economically vulnerable students. This expresses my personal opinion on the matter."
